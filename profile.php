			<h1>Keep the creative<br>juices flowing.</h1>
			<p>We are living in an increasingly design-savvy world where brands find their homes in the minds and hearts of individuals. Design makes a crucial difference. When consumers identify beauty, they get a sense that their lives will be improved by it. Design opens doors to patronage and trust. To loyalty.
			<br><br>
			A little bit of background:
			<br><br>
			For the past 9 years, Lemonjuice has played major roles in various projects that focus on art direction, branding, print and interactive design, retail and advertising media, environmental design, e-commerce, and integrated email campaigns.
			<br><br>
			This zest for visual design exceeds the everyday job. Inspired by the dialogue between objects and people, and how the constant stream of visual stimuli affects our responses and choices in an ever evolving world, Lemonjuice believes we ought to think of and use design not merely as a material phenomenon, but a significant shaper of community and culture.</p>
